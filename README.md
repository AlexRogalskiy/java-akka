Java akka sample executions (Cluster, Distributed, simple system)

These are some samples just to try as POCs for actual implementation in my project. 
This includes:  
  1) communication within  the same cluster 
  2) communication from outside the cluster using cluster client and receptionist 
  3) communication using actor identity selection.
